## Installing
- Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/BlackOpsOne/BO1-PointsTracker/releases) section and download `BO1-PointsTracker.exe`, then open it along side the game.

- This does not work with the Microsoft Store version of the game.

- Since this goes based on your current points, it will only track accurately from the point in your game that you open it at. If you want it to track from the start, open it before loading the map, you get the idea.

## Toggling Points Lost
Open the `points-tracker.ini` config file and set `DisplayPointsLost` to `No`.
